friday april 8 2005 professor perry bartlett of university of queensland s brain institute recommends sex cryptic crosswords and a good run to stave off dementia the researcher interviewed on australian abc radio today 1 said that with 52 000 australians expected to be diagnosed with dementia by the end of the year people wishing to ward off the degenerative disorder may benefit from activities which stimulate growth of new cells in the brain accompanied by mental exercise to select for survival of the resulting crop of new cells  quite prolonged exercise is very good to make new neurones said the professor these new nerve cells are really quite vital to our ability to function in the higher brain functions such as memory and learning most of them die we now know that we can preserve some of them by giving direct stimuli professor bartlett explained recent research findings including those from collaborator jeffrey d macklis 2 at harvard in the us  there are a lot of hormones and changes in blood that go up and down after exercise and so that may be a lead to some of the chemicals that can drive the production of nerve cells  one of the chemicals that seems to promote neurogenesis is prolactin and prolactin levels are very high in pregnant females prolactin levels by the way also go up during sex as well so one could think of a number of more entertaining activities than running in order to regulate the production of nerve cells  perhaps doing something a little more inquisitive or intellectual might be good at selecting their survival so perhaps one should run a long distance and do the cryptic crossword or something like that he said professor bartlett gave the same suggestions as being potentially helpful in depression last year in an interview on the abc science show 3 share this this page is archived and is no longer publicly editable got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections note that some listed sources or external links may no longer be available online due to age got a correction add the template editprotected to the talk page along with your corrections and it will be brought to the attention of the administrators please note that due to our archival policy we will not alter or update the content of articles that are archived but will only accept requests to make grammatical and formatting corrections
