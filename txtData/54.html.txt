change minister james shaw sold out to farmers promising them another five years of free pollution on top of the decade they ve had since the ets was passed and 25 years since we first planned it farmers were meant to use this time to come up with a method of fairly pricing emissions at the farm level and to provide an incentive they would be brought into the emissions trading scheme at the processor level dairy factories and meat works if they didn t the bill or rather sop to implement that is now before select committee i travelled down to wellington yesterday to submit on it and got to hear the submissions of peak farming bodies dairy nz federated farmers and beef lamb nz while hanging around while all of them made positive noises about on farm emissions measurement they were universally virulently opposed to actually joining the ets and to the backstop measures which would keep them honest they also generally wanted to limit forestry offsets as well which are currently outcompeting them the government s partner on agricultural emissions reduction is dealing in bad faith this shouldn t be any surprise farmers and farming bodies have been at the heart of climate change denial in new zealand and they ve followed the usual pattern of shifting focus from opposing science to opposing action as the situation has become clearer back in the early 2000 s they even drove a tractor up parliament steps to oppose paying for research on how to reduce their emissions apparently we were meant to subsidise them on that just like we have on actual emissions their core strategy has been to delay drag their feet and dump the costs on the rest of us and they re still doing it we shouldn t fall for it as for how to stop it the answer is simple bring agriculture into the ets at the producer level immediately that way they actually have a real incentive to come up with a robust method to price on farm emissions and delay hurts them rather than us sadly even with australia on fire the chances of this government taking real action to reduce agricultural emissions is remote posted by idiot savant at 1 31 2020 09 58 00 am links to this post labels agricultural

funding nationalfor the past twenty years the right has plotted to raise the retirement age supposedly because preventing old people from starving to death is unsustainable of course it would also let them deliver an enormous tax cut to their cronies which tells us that its financial sustainability is simply a matter of priorities and that theirs are focused solely on the rich rather than the 99 of new zealanders who need this but the good news is that the retirement commissioner who had previously supported such a raise on precisely those specious grounds has changed their mind and the reasons why are illuminating posted by idiot savant at 1 29 2020 02 54 00 pm links to this post labels equality housing leftlate last year in the face of economic bad news the government announced a massive 12 billion infrastructure spending programme to keep the economy ticking over given shortages of housing and public transport and the pressing need to decarbonise our economy this could have been a massive opportunity to fix some of our problems while pointing new zealand in a better direction instead the government has squandered it with a package consisting almost entirely of big roading projects often with benefit cost ratios of less than 1 meaning that the costs outweigh the benefits even when using nzta s dodgy accounting oh there s some money for rail but its all just catch up spending with nothing transformational electrifying the gaps in the main trunk line linking christchurch to its exurbs with commuter rail nope instead we just have more roads so trucks will have a quicker journey meanwhile the government is spending all of 10 million on decarbonisation whoop de fucking shit this is chump change on a government scale and it shows how little they care supposedly there s more in the pipeline but in total they re planning to spend only 1 6 of this package on making new zealand ready for a carbon free future as for solar and wind farms to put huntly out of business or more electric charging stations to boost electric vehicle uptake or state houses with solar roofs as standard of course not its environmental tokenism nothing more it may achieve its economic stimulus objective but paying people to bury money in the ground and dig it up again does that the question is what else it does whether we get lasting assets and whether they re worth having and in this case the government has spent money to put us on track to a high carbon future rather than a low carbon one it is a squandered opportunity and a complete failure of imagination posted by

day election and well before the trump hits the fan in the us the no longer new practice of announcing the election date well in advance is good and puts everyone on a more even footing compared to the bad old days when the pm could literally get drunk and announce it for next month at the same time by getting to choose the government gets to choose the most advantageous timing for themselves which is hardly a level electoral playing field it would be much better if this power was removed from the hands of politicians and instead the date was legislated so as to end political game playing

on climate change its the usual list reduce meat don t fly consume less i m doing some of this myself and none of it hurts but the way our economic system is constructed means the impact of such actions is limited shifting to a plant based diet is not going to stop the dairy industry our biggest emitter from poisoning our atmosphere soils and rivers because 95 of what it produces is exported to rich pricks overseas using public transport is not going to shut down the trucking industry our next biggest polluter buying less crap is not going to stop tiwai point from using 10 of the country s entire electricity supply or help shut down huntly and other fossil fuel power stations and driving an electric car is not going to close off those gas wells in taranaki or stop omv from drilling for more in the great south basin sure all of these tiny individual actions all add up in the way that raindrops wear mountains down to dust but its not the most effective method of reducing emissions what is the most effective method politics all of those industries depend on regulation and all of them can be regulated out of existence or to pollute less and less until they cease to be a problem and that means electing governments who will do that and putting the pressure on parties to adopt climate friendly policies not bullshit half measures like giving agriculture a 90 pollution subsidy or banning new fossil fuel exploration but extending existing permits forever and letting them dig up and burn whatever they find but reducing those industries to a level consistent with human survival and doing it as quickly as possible currently our political choices are climate arsonists who don t care if we all burn to death national do nothings who pretend concern but fundamentally refuse to upset the destructive status quo labour or well intentioned sellouts the greens at least under their current leadership these are not good choices but putting pressure on parties will force them to change their positions and force stronger policies and we do that by marching by occupying by speaking up and by voting this is an election year the year where our voices count where politicians have to at least pretend to listen and suffer the electoral consequences if they don t so if you want real action on climate change get involved and speak up it s the only action that counts posted by
