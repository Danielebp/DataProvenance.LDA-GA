aspirations to independent statehood and he is widely regarded in his homeland as the father of czech music internationally he is best known for his opera the bartered bride and for the symphonic cycle my fatherland which portrays the history legends and landscape of the composer s native land smetana was naturally gifted as a pianist and gave his first public performance at the age of six and wrote his first piece of nationalistic music during the 1848 prague uprising in which he briefly participated during the liberal political climate in his country during the 1860 s he threw himself into the musical life of prague primarily as a champion of the new genre of czech opera his first two operas the brandenburgers in bohemia and the bartered bride premiered in 1866 the latter achieving great popularity that same year he became prague s new provisional theatre principal conductor but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy factions within the city s musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of franz liszt and richard wagner at odds to the development of a distinctively czech opera style smetana soon became ill and a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears which soon rendered him deaf a press announcement stated that smetana had become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people soon after he reluctantly accepted an annual pension of 1 200 gulden and resigned as principal conductor due to his health problems it was after this event in his life which he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems called my fatherland as well as other major works which cemented his reputation as the principal exponent of czech national music however in 1879 smetana had written to a friend revealing fears of the onset of madness by the winter of 1882 83 he was experiencing depression insomnia and hallucinations together with giddiness cramp and a temporary loss of speech in october 1883 his behavior at a private reception in prague disturbed his friends and by the middle of february 1884 he had ceased to be coherent and was periodically violent on 23 april his family unable to nurse him any longer removed him to a lunatic asylum in prague where he died on 12 may 1884 according to musicologist john tyrrell smetana s close identification with czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years have tended to affect the objectivity with which his work has been assessed particularly in his native land though in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognize smetana and he had been twice married lost three daughters in infancy and eventually went mad he laid the groundwork for the flowering of czech music paving the way for the even more famous anton n dvor k and those are the top headlines for wednesday may 12th 2010this has been the audio wikinews brief to receive the latest news please visit wikinews org
