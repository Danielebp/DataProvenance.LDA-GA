stables and other outbuildings as dry conditions threaten the residents of california the worst flooding in 80 years in pakistan has left at least 800 people dead and affected over a million more the floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains and have destroyed homes in the country especially in the northern province of khyber pakhtunkhwa the pakistan meteorological department said that twelve inches of rain fell over a 36 hour period sohail rahman reporting for al jazeera from pakistan s capital of islamabad said that islamabad experienced a deluge of water flowing south from khyber pakhtoonkhwa he went on to say that floods have really affected the infrastructure in and around the province the people in the affected areas were quite critical in the first 24 hours saying that the authorities were not doing enough rescue operations have been hampered by the weather while seventeen helicopters are operating with more to come they cannot operate in all areas due to the weather and just 48 boats are available for use by rescue crews last wednesday the bad weather was also to blame for a passenger plane crash which killed all 152 on board four days later on saturday investigators found the black box and flight data recorder of airblue flight 202 that crashed into the margalla hills of pakistan s capital city junaid amin the head of pakistan s civil aviation authority told cnn that the recorders will be sent to either germany or france which have the necessary resources to analyze the data such an investigation could take months to complete however the black box records communication data and technical information such as speed and altitude as well as conversations in the airplane cockpit it could thus help investigators determine why the plane crashed another air disaster this time in alaska took place on sunday whena cargo plane crashed into a mountain in alaska s denali national park killing around three people and sparking a small wildfire after the aircraft disintegrated and burst into flames according to the national park service the plane crashed into the southern slope of mount healy and the crash was just 200 yards away from denali s only road though it is estimated that three people died in the crash it has been hard to determine exactly how many died as according to park spokeswoman kris fister the plane pretty much disintegrated the explosion from the crash sparked a small wildfire that firefighters contained within two acres one hectare though george clare a man from las vegas who witnessed the crash thought the plane looked like a military aircraft us military officials have stated that none of their planes were involved clare has said that the plane was a military khaki green kind of color it was propellor driven it was a fixed wing aircraft and it had kind of a flat underbelly jeff kowalczyk an emt hiking through the 6 075 107 acre park with his wife a nurse said that he saw the plane positioned almost upside down as it crashed the crash was only a few hundred yards from where he was watching and he also said the whole experience was really surreal the crash came just four days after another major airplane crash that happened in the vicinity when a military cargo plane crashed a minute after taking off at the elmendorf air force base in anchorage the crash killed four people onboard who were training for an airshow last wednesday marked the 100th day since the beginning of the deepwater horizon oil spill and although the leaking well was recently capped the estimated three million or more barrels of oil already in the gulf of mexico are still causing trouble for many residents of the gulf coast there are still many unanswered questions about the long term impact of the spill including how it has affected the environment and natural habitats of the gulf as well as whether residents of the area will be able to return to their jobs and livelihoods now that the leak has been capped us government officials say that even after the oil well is permanently sealed workers will still have a lot to do including the removal of around 20 million feet of containment boom i would characterize this as the first 100 days there s a lot of work in front of us said rear admiral paul zukunft of the us coast guard authorities will use submarines to assess damage underwater while teams on the ground assess the shoreline while removing oil from beaches is expected to be fairly straightforward cleaning the marshlands will be particularly difficult as boats are needed to maneuver through small channels and workers are unable to stand on solid ground at least 638 miles 1 027 kilometres of the gulf coast have been hit by the oil the government is focusing on both cleaning sensitive coastal regions and looking for underwater oil plumes but is also probing into what may have been the largest accidental oil spill the us justice department as well as louisiana mississippi and alabama are all investigating what contributed to the disaster the washington post reported one team is looking into whether a close relationship between bp and government regulators played a role in the spill the post also said that deepwater horizon operator transocean as well as oil services group halliburton were being investigated bp officials say that they will try to perform the static kill process on monday a process which involves pumping a thick mixture of mud and cement down into the cap currently stopping the leak at the end of next week one of two relief wells currently being drilled should reach the leaking well and officials will then know if the static kill has worked it is hoped that this bottom kill operation will be able to permanently seal the damaged well even though bp is close to sealing the oil reservoir it still faces legal battles economic struggles and internal changes on tuesday bp announced tony hayward would step down from his position as the company s chief executive his replacement american bob dudley will be the first non british ceo of the company on thursday lawyers met at a boise idaho hearing to determine how around 200 various lawsuits against bp will play out depending on whether the suits can be consolidated bp could be facing years of legal disputes bp transocean and halliburton had already blamed each other for the disaster during a may hearing before the us senate federal regulatory officials were criticized for allegedly taking bribes and not thoroughly inspecting the oil rig the company also reported a quarterly loss of us 16 9 billion and said it has allocated us 32 2 billion to pay for the spill bp has a us 20 billion fund to help make up for the massive losses of the gulf fishing oil and tourism industries and will pay damages for each of the millions of barrels of oil lost in the disaster bp says that it is the responsible party for cleaning up the spill because it owned the leaking well and had leased the deepwater horizon oil rig but claims that it is not responsible for the entire spill the overall economic picture for the united sates was just as gloomy asthe us

from his novel the unbearable lightness of being the quote reads we can never know what to want because living only one life we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come in other words things are clear in retrospect but not as they are happening it is no mistake then that this quote opens the beginning to a collection of short stories by rayomd carver who died on this day in history in 1988 carver who was only 50 when he died described himself as inclined toward brevity and intensity his writing focused on the blue collar experience and was clearly reflective of his own life a life of alcoholism and recovery and most importantly the theme of communication or more accurately the inability and struggle to communicate with ourselves and each other carver came from humble beginnings he was born in clatskanie oregon a mill town along the columbia river and grew up in yakima washington his father a skilled sawmill worker from arkansas was a fisherman and a heavy drinker and his mother worked on and off as a waitress and retail clerk as a child he busied himself reading mickey spillane crime novels and being an active hunter and fisherman sports and outdoor recreation magazines after high school at the age of 19 in june 1957 he worked in the sawmill with his father and married maryann burk who was 16 at the time their daughter christine la rae was born in december the same year when carver was 20 he supported his family by working as a janitor sawmill laborer delivery man and library assistant while maryann worked as a waitress salesperson administrative assistant and high school english teacher the family then moved to california where maryann s mother lived and carver soon became interested in writing while attending a creative writing course he met the novelist john gardner who would become his mentor and ultimately had a major influence on carver s life and career by 1963 after attending chico state university and humboldt state college carver had earned his ba and began to publish and edit in the university literary magazine toyon in 1968 while working as a night custodian he published his first book of poetry titled near klamath with the guidance of poet dennis schmitz for three years he held a job as a textbook editor for science research associates but was fired in 1970 for his inappropriate writing style however at this piont his writing career began to take off carver s writing style and themes are often identified with ernest hemingway and anton chekhov with minimalism being generally seen as one of the hallmarks of carver s work this style grew from gardner s advice for carver to use fifteen words instead of twenty five and more dramatically when carver was being edited by the famed esquire magazine editor gordon lish to use five in place of fifteen however objecting to the surgical amputation and transplantation of lish s heavy editing carver eventually broke with him his style has also been described as dirty realism which connected him with a group of writers in the 1970s and 1980s that included richard ford tobias wolff two writers carver was closely acquainted with as well as ann beattie and jayne anne phillips with the exception of beattie who wrote about upper middle class people these were writers who focused on sadness and loss in the everyday lives of ordinary people often lower middle class or isolated and marginalized people who represent henry david thoreau s idea of living lives of quiet desperation carver s focus on short stories and poems was that the story or poem can be written and read in one sitting this was not simply a preference but particularly at the beginning of his career a practical consideration as he juggled writing with work and family during his years of working different jobs rearing children and trying to write carver started to drink heavily by his own admission eventually he more or less gave up writing and took to full time drinking in the fall semester of 1973 carver was a teacher in the iowa writers workshop with john cheever but carver stated that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing the next year after leaving iowa city cheever went to a treatment center to attempt to overcome his alcoholism but carver continued drinking for three years after being hospitalized three times between june 1976 and february or march 1977 carver began his second life and stopped drinking on june 2 1977 with the help of alcoholics anonymous by 1984 carver was nominated for his second national book award for his collection of short stories titled cathedral a story carver saw as a watershed in his career in its shift towards a more optimistic and confidently poetic style it is within this collection that carver s theme of communication and human connectedness is most apparent in the story titled a small good thing carver writes about a family who have just lost their child after being hit by a car in a minor accident in the story he writes ann the boy s mother gazed out into the parking lot and then turned around and looked back at the front of the hospital she began shaking her head no no she said i can t leave him here no she heard herself say that and though how unfair it was that the only words that came out were the sort of words used on tv shows where people were stunned by violent or sudden deaths she wanted her words to be her own in cathedral a small good thing is printed near the halfway point of the collection yet the final story the titular cathedral resolves this inability for characters to communicate in the story the main character is asked to draw a cathedral for an old blind man who has no concept of a cathedral a task he is reluctant to do but in the process of moving the pen across the paper as the old blind man holds onto the main characters pen hand he experiences a brief moment of revelation which he can only describe as it s really something much like the main character carver had experienced a real breakthrough and by this point he was considered one of the major figures in american literature however in 1988 only 6 weeks after marrying his second wife tess gallagher herself a writer he died of lung cancer at only 50 years old yet carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 if he hadn t found a way to stop drinking when he knew the cancer would kill him he wrote a poem about that bonus of 10 years called gravy so while me may not know how to make sense of our lives as we live them we can at least appreciate them in the short time we all have and those are the top headlines for monday august 02 2010this has been the audio wikinews brief to receive the latest news please
