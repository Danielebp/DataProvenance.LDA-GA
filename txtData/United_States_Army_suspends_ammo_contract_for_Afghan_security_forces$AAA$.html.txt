factor according to our folks in afghanistan they have had no safety incidents reported and no reports of any ammunition that has malfunctioned associated with this particular contract whitman told the press he also denied that the issue happened because the army awarded the contract to the lowest bidder and that he was not aware of aey s qualifications to fulfill the contract  as the united states government does business they are obviously always trying to ensure they get the best value he said but that does not mean that in achieving the best value for the taxpayer that we will accept
