Spanblather
the leftward and other blatherings of span now with snaps and so spanblather ends and i think i ought to explain some of the why the slow down here started because i simply did not have much time or health to spend on blogging when that situation improved i found i no longer had the inclination to write here or indeed anywhere as span the simple fact is that i m just not span anymore span was a part of me rooted in my student activist days and i ve been slowly evolving away from that person for the last 18 months several events have led me to conclude that there s no longer much span in me these days not least the impact of a disclosure of rape that was made to me last year by someone i love very much i feel that the writing i have done here on the issue of rape and sexual violence even before this disclosure was not something span would really have understood certainly not something she would have been able to write about when she first took form in the late mid 90s sure span was involved in a radical feminist group for a while and felt strongly about the issues but she could never really identify with them personally it was always in the abstract that s changed for good or ill similarly my witterings about s59 motherhood and sex were areas the original span would probably not have ventured into she was too busy running around campus because walking anywhere was just too slow focused on the game playing side of politics rather than the day to day realities of life the future always seemed like it would be glorious and full of radical activity span was a person who was always going to be young in many senses of the world the early span would never have found domesticity at all fulfilling or interesting sleeping was a resented task that would be done only when strictly necessary and any second not spent doing something anything was a second wasted even when i had cfs that span mentality still existed within the parameters of life dictated by the illness which may be one of the reasons i was sick for three years other parts of my life have changed too and i m happy with the new person i m becoming as louise l hay as that sounds i feel constrained by span now instead of liberated this pseudonym limits me rather than allowing me a forum to write about whatever i want without fear of being judged by those who know me in the real world certainly i enjoyed surprising people who discovered my real identity when this blog was reasonably new in particular those who had assumed span was a man span was in many ways a sex less entity but that certainly hasn t been true of my writing over the last 18 months partly because of the emergence of capitalism bad which has inspired me in many ways enough with the odd third person wankery thanks so much for reading and commenting and emailing and debating for the most part i ve found it stimulating and enjoyable i m particularly glad that there are now several excellent nz lefty women bloggers out there writing about feminism and politics notably maia deborah tze ming jo and anna i look forward to reading their stuff and will probably still comment around the traps albeit not as span good luck to them and also to my other imaginary friends idiot savant aucklander at large just left ghet make tea not war joe hendren those funny folk at brain stab and the dear frank stupid i m not going to delete this blog i m too vain about the good writing i have done to send it to trash i ll allow comments for a while longer and then probably switch them off or put them on moderation i d hate for this site to become a spam farm my spanblather email won t be cleared much so those who use it may want to get in touch in the next week or so before i start ignoring it so that we can maintain contact through other avenues and because i can t end this last post on the banality of email addresses and spam here s a quote from the wonderful ineffable dna and in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters everybody concerned lived happily ever after there was a point to this story but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler s mind posted by span at 2 26 pm 40 comments links to this postlabels bloggingthere is so much i want to write about at the moment but i m having some problems finding much time and then i feel like the moment has passed i had hoped that the low level of posting of the last few months was over but it seems that is not the case sorry to be slack and i have no promises i can realistically make about when this might change it seems a real shame because spanblather is now over three years old and this year has been the best so far i don t want to give the blog away altogether and i don t want to go on hiatus but that s what is happening by default really i m not sure why i m bothering to write this other than to explain a little to readers i m not sick nothing is wrong i just simply don t have a lot of time now or for the forseeable future and once you stop blogging as part of your everyday life it gets harder to find the time to fit it back in again in my experience posted by span at 4 51 pm 12 comments links to

of interest i ve now had the unique experience of having kiwiblog commenters praise me for my principled approach and being castigated in my own comments section by some people i respect yes including you craig r for not being principled about dbp not being a feminist unionist about setchell and generally not supporting the political neutrality of the public service all of this has given me pause i ve already added my additional thoughts about dbp to the comment thread on my original post but suffice to say the revelations of the last week have reinforced my opinion that he had to go and i m very relieved he has my thinking about setchell s employment has evolved a bit since i posted last week i ve been pondering whether there would have been a perceived or actual conflict of interest if the employment issues had been the other way around if setchell already had the mfe job and taylor was applying to be john key s chief presser resoundingly the answer has to be no but i m not sure it s entirely because of gender it would be to national s advantage to have a press sec with a connection high up in the mfe and so they wouldn t want to veto taylor s appointment from that point of view if the mfe had concerns about setchell at that point it would be interesting to see how they would raise them in a legally appropriate way all of this is of course totally hypothetical but something craig wrote struck a particular nerve within me i had commented that i was often judged on the political activity of my partner and that i had hated it and craig thought this made my view of the setchell affair even worse this has got me thinking how has that judgement i sometimes face manifested and does it make setchell a fellow traveller to me i ve been political since long before i met my partner we were in different parties when we met and we ve managed to negotiate the collapse of the coalition between our two parties in 2002 without much stress between us we share things and we trust each other and although there have been times each of us could have used something shared between us to the political advantage of our own party that hasn t happened once perhaps the example of own parents has stood us in good sted in both cases our fathers are right wing and our mothers from longtime labour families and yet both marriages are still strong after over twenty five years together the main problems for me have been that people assume i am in the same party as my partner and that i hold the same views as them oddly by them i mean the person doing the assuming usually not necessarily my partner this is mainly an irritant because it means that people ring nickname pending up to ask about various things and when he s not here they are disappointed and occassionally angry that i a don t know the answer and b am not instantly enthusiastic about whatever they want to talk about the times that the assumption goes above the level of irritation are mainly to do with blogging accusations that i am writing something here for spin purposes or because my partner told me to or that i am arguing with someone else on another blog for those same reasons rather than thinking and writing for myself drive me batty even when i was on the alliance national council and wrote about alliance things here it was never been at the behest of someone else or to put out the party line when my partner had a blog i did comment on it but not to be sycophantic at times i disagreed with him i did stand up to bullying i saw happening on his blog as i have on jordan s and tony s and the blogs of others i do this because i don t like bullying aka trolling and i find it at times amusing to take the piss out of those who bully not because i am particularly passionately wounded on the target s behalf but more because i like to think i can be witty from time to time but i do tend to hide my partner s name and political affiliation under a bushel when it comes to my work and this is where setchell and i may have more in common than i had first imagined my colleagues all know nickname pending but i won t be sharing his political activities with the union members i represent anytime soon not because i think it will get me in trouble with them i hasten to add i don t tell them about my affiliations either and although my real identity is reasonably widely known amongst blogging circles i use a pseudonym here and i ve stopped writing letters to the editor because i would hate to think that a member felt they couldn t seek help because they found my political views or that of my partner distasteful when it s a matter of politics at work then my official view to members and others will be that of my employer not mine i ve walked that fine line before when i was on the ausa exec and opposed the lowering of the drinking age it was ausa policy to support it and it was my portfolio which had to do the talking and i did it no problem at all i guess ultimately i prefer the delegate model rather than the trustee approach to political representation so was it unreasonable given my personal experience to think setchell shouldn t have got the mfe job in the first place i m less decided than i was when i reflect on how my partner and i manage to share political gossip and information without too many problems i can t help thinking that it isn t so hard because we are broadly on the same side in 2002 when our shared computer was full of emails with strategy information from one party and i was on the campaign committee of the other i was pressured once to provide some inside info to my party i demurred and that was respected but that was over a short period of time and neither of us was employed by our opposing organisations could we do that could anyone do that balance along that tight rope particularly if they were political people for months or years and potentially act against the interests of their employer by not sharing what they knew i hope so for the sake of our public service and for the sake of those many people who have a political partner whether they are political themselves or not in the setchell case the jobs are particularly sensitive chief press sec for the opposition leader and communications officer for a key ministry where have i meandered to with all this on the one hand i still think it is politically naive to not see that there is a genuine potential for conflict of interest in the setchell case the perception is almost as bad as the reality from my point of view i don t think i would even apply for a job that would mean muttering behind hands everytime i walked past or workmates withholding information from me for fear of who i might share it with on the other hand i do think our public service should be neutral and thus the political affiliations of public servants or their families should be irrelevant to most appointments and i certainly know what it is like to have your partner s politics thrust in your face and unfair assumptions made i also know that it is something women are more likely to face than men to the best of my knowledge nickname pending has never had anyone even consider that my political affiliations or activities would have any bearing on him each man is an island it seems on balance i think i may have changed my mind ultimately i know it is possible to operate a relationship across political lines albeit difficult at times sadly the fact that many other people don t know that seems to be the main barrier to success assumedly only on dbp as i disagreed with dpf on the issue of setchell s conflict of interest which he started well after spanblather began but that didn t stop many people from assuming that my blog s purpose was to back him up little woman indeed i now support the current age too by the way in the past mfe wouldn t have been all that important really but with the competition over policy on climate change that is no longer the case i didn t get a chance to read all of matt mccarten s column on this in the hos but the fact that he thinks setchell shouldn t have got the job has made me wonder what mccarten really thought when i was on the alliance council and executive let alone the campaign committee posted by span at 9 25 am 9 comments links to this postlabels alliance employment feminism john key labour national the game of politicssometimes on the inter tubes you find something that you just don t think can possible be serious for example josh at brain stab alerted me to this discussion about whether women girls can should play rugby at nz conservative it depressed me because sadly i know that many of the participants are serious about their views of women and men and how limited we supposedly all are in our neat little gender boxes for the record i wanted to play rugger as a girl in primary school i did play briefly although it was a sanitised little kids version i never thought it odd that we had mixed teams for our mock world cup at least until i got to intermediate where the only winter sports options were netball or hockey i wasn t the only girl in my age group to express an interest in playing rugby but we knew it was hopeless to try i understand that very same girls school does offer it now which is great anything that encourages them to think outside the concept that netball is all is a good thing it s also worth pondering this the nz women s rugby team known as the black ferns have won the last three world cups unlike certain other national nz rugby teams i could name and here s another site inspiring disbelief in a much more cheering manner pantalaine supplies or supplied or perhaps pretends to supply some rather odd clothing such as this fetching top don t say i never bring you anything weird from the interwab  as in you cannot be serious after writing this post yesterday but not posting it i had a dream last night where i was going to be in a

postlabels marai m of the opinion these days that david benson pope should go too many scandals and too much taint fair or unfair he s a distraction and a liability and even though he could be doing a good job as a cabinet member he is doing a bad job as part of the public face of this government and by extension of the centre left sometimes in politics you have to step back from a fight even though you haven t done anything wrong i m not saying that is necessarily the case for dbp but i suspect he feels he hasn t offended however the public perception is against him and if he wants his team to win then he may have to accept a place on the reserve bench or even in the stand watching he hasn t handled the madeliene setchell affair well even though i kind of agree that she probably shouldn t have got the job conflicts of interest are also about perception and from what i understand about the sensitivity of the job setchell was employed for it seems she would have been at considerable risk of people assuming that she was passing information on to her national party staffer partner or that she was in turn including ideas national would have liked in her advice ministry and parliamentary jobs of this nature require a high level of trust this is so integral that a breakdown of trust and relationship is considered a legitimate reason for terminating employment with a three month pay out period i think it s sad that setchell couldn t have done this job without raising eyebrows i write this as someone with a particular interest in not being judged on the politics or position of their partner who is in a different party from me the fact that our public service has become more politicised in the last twenty years is undeniable though nicky hager had some interesting things to say about this in his lecture on the hollow men earlier this year he points to the fourth labour government and the national government of the 90s that followed as the drivers of change in this regard hager believes that there has been a great purging of those holding opinions against deregulation privatisation and the like certainly that might explain why even our current labour led government seems to be unable to think outside many of the systems set up under governments ostensibly further to the right it also explains why the service has changed so much that alarum bells were set off by setchell s appointment the outcome of all this hasn t been fair to setchell and it may not be fair to dbp either but that s politics sometimes it s isn t always right but there

solid chap what is it with us kiwis and our first xv mentality that we some how think that because someone is good at rugger they are therefore a higher class of being many of us will have experienced this phenomenon at high school where the first xv were often above laws and rules and able to revel in their perceived social and moral superiority with impunity let me cite sitiveni sivivatu s

of my passion for harbour my odd affection for low profile past players like terry wright matt cardy and frano botica before he went to league and my inability to actually watch a test anymore because i get too uptight about the outcome but loving the game doesn t mean i have to put my brain in reverse and devolve back to a time when people took the words of the monarch or the priest as truth just
