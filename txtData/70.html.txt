british broadcasting corporationhomeaccessibility linksthe arctic is losing its old thick ice faster than in previous years according to satellite data the loss has continued since the end of the arctic summer despite cold weather across the northern hemisphere the warm 2007 summer saw the smallest area of ice ever recorded in the region and scientists say 2008 could follow a similar pattern older floes are thicker and less saline than newly formed ice meaning they can survive warm spells better the shrinking of arctic ice has global implications as its white surface reflects solar energy back into space whereas the open ocean absorbs it long marchmarch is the month when the arctic ice usually reaches its largest extent as the dark winter nears its end nasa s data shows the area covered by ice is roughly the same as it was last year but this masks a significant change  although this march the area is slightly larger than last march the area of thick perennial ice has reached an all time low said seelye martin manager of the cryospheric sciences program at nasa headquarters in washington dc  so the volume of arctic ice continues to decrease the winter ice loss is thought to be driven mainly by the transport of old floes from arctic waters out into the atlantic ocean the currents driving this are stronger than usual as a consequence of another natural cycle the arctic oscillation the net result is that most of the cover consists of ice that has formed since last summer the scientists behind these findings believe this year s cooling should not obscure the long term warming trend with temperatures across the arctic rising about twice as fast as the global average  weather comes and goes and it s the long term average that really matters observed josefino comiso from nasa s goddard space flight center dr comiso said he believed that the change of albedo the change from a white reflective surface of ice to a dark absorbing surface of sea was already happening summer sailingwith the ice pack containing such a high proportion of thin salty ice the scientists believe another major melt is likely in the summer  it may look ok on the surface but it s like looking at a hollywood movie set you see the facade of a building and it looks ok but if you look behind it there s no building there last summer the sharp melt meant that the northwest passage the fabled navigation route linking the atlantic and pacific oceans across the top of north america was easily navigable the disappearance of ice cover has countries around the arctic eagerly eyeing the mineral reserves that may become accessible most projections of climate change in the arctic suggest the ocean may become ice free by the middle of the century but one forecast released late last year said it could happen by 2013 richard black internet bbc co ukwhat are these most popular now 56 514 people are reading stories on the site right now search term copyright 2019 bbc the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites read more this page is best viewed in an up to date web browser with style sheets css enabled while you will be able to view the content of this page in your current browser you will not be able to get the full visual experience please consider upgrading your browser software or enabling style sheets css if you are able to do so
