618.html.txt##lda_delimiter##wahlrechts  news  strategische stimmabgabe im wahlkreis dresden i die den oktober angek ndigte nachwahl aufgrund des pl tzlichen todes einer dresdner wahlkreiskandidatin hat deutschland eine regelrechte wahlhysterie ausgel st selbst hellmuth karasek erte sich heute zu berhangmandaten zweitstimmen und verh ltniswahlrecht alles themen mit denen man zwischen den wahlen bei den meisten lesern und zuh rern bestenfalls des hnen und abwinken hervorruft auch wenn wahlrecht de schon einige stunden bevor die meldung donnerstag morgen durch die massenmedien verbreitet wurde neben der nachwahlank ndigung auf die rechtlich problematische situation hinwies die meisten medien legten den focus ihrer berichterstattung auf die verz gerung der bekanntgabe des wahlergebnisses durch den bundeswahlleiter und den kampf um das direktmandat keineswegs minder spannend ist aber ein blick auf die glichen wahlstrategischen berlegungen mit denen sich die dresdner nach dem september auseinandersetzen werden ssen um keine gewagten spekulationen ber den ausgang der diesj hrigen wahl anstellen zu ssen bietet es sich von dem wahlergebnis der bundestagswahl auszugehen wenn man unter diesen umst nden die union mit der zweitstimme hlt sste man ihr schon schaden wollen und die partei um einen sitz wie den ihres kandidaten siegbert meseck bringen wollen politische gegner der cdu nnten genau aus diesem grund erw gen die cdu mit der zweitstimme zu hlen damit rden und wurden die hler dresden opfer einer sehr merkw rdigen eigenschaft des bundestagswahlsystems den sogenannten negativen stimmgewichten denn tats chlich hatten im wahlkreis dresden hler mit der zweitstimme cdu gew hlt ende cdu stimmen zuviel die dem cdu kandidaten siegbert meseck das mandat gekostet haben excel datei zum nachrechnen die negativen stimmgewichte beeinflussen aber nicht nur die hler dresden allen bundesl ndern denen berhangmandate auftreten nnen gilt die anh nger der berhangpartei bzw anh nger des gew nschten koalitionspartners da man mit der zweitstimme glichst nicht die berh ngende partei hlen sollte die cdu sachsen oder die spd brandenburg siehe tipps und tricks zur bundestagswahl notwendig negatives stimmengewicht diesem umfang und damit solch abstrus anmutende wahlempfehlungen ist das auftreten von berhangmandaten bzw vielen direktmandaten da kandidaten auf der landesliste nicht zum zuge kommen dass es sachsen zu berhangmandaten kommen wird ist recht wahrscheinlich wahlrecht de kommt bei einer hochrechnung des ergebnisses der letzten bundestagswahl unter ber cksichtigung aktueller umfragen auf dreizehn gewonnene wahlkreise die cdu sachsen aber nur auf einen anspruch von elf sitzen nach zweitstimmen und damit auf zwei berhangmandate angesichts dessen nnte es nach dem september dresden zu einem erst merkw rdigen wahlkampf kommen wahlk mpfer der cdu die die hler auffordern den cdu kandidaten zu hlen aber bitte bitte nicht die cdu landesliste und eventuell sogar spd wahlk mpfer die um zweitstimmen die cdu werben um die gr der cdu csu fraktion zu reduzieren nach ver ffentlichung der ergebnisse der anderen wahlkreise wird wahlrecht de eine analoge berechnung erstellen und ver ffentlichen und zwar unabh ngig davon ob der bundeswahlleiter etwas ver ffentlichen darf oder nicht entsprechend der letzten bundestagswahl versuchen wir wieder fr als der bundeswahlleiter ein ergebnis ein vorl ufiges endergebnis ist es diesmal ja nicht zu ver ffentlichen dies geschieht nat rlich nicht sollten die wahlurnen september um uhr tats chlich versiegelt bleiben dann wundern wir uns aber auch nicht ber das zwei wochen sp ter bei der ausz hlung der stimmen herauskommt grund daf sind aber nicht das halbe dutzend verfassungsbeschwerden bzw eilantr ge die nach den heutigen agenturmeldungen beim bundesverfassungsgericht mit dem ziel erhoben bzw gestellt wurden die ver ffentlichung des vorl ufigen bundesweiten ergebnisses zu verhindern und ber die nach angaben einer gerichtssprecherin noch diese woche entschieden werden soll denn hierbei ist nach st ndiger rechtsprechung des gerichts davon auszugehen da diese beschwerden und antr ge als unzul ssig abgewiesen werden und auch durch geheimhaltung der ergebnisse verschwindet das negative stimmgewicht nicht jedoch haben es die richter des zweiten senats noch der hand diesen absurden effekt des negativen stimmgewichts rechtzeitig vor der bundestagswahl zu verhindern eine wahlpr fungsbeschwerde einer hlerin gegen die negativen stimmgewichte der letzten wahl die chsischen negativen cdu stimmen die dem cdu mann meseck das mandat gekostet haben ist monate nach der letzten bundestagswahl noch immer beim bundesverfassungsgericht anh ngig az bvc hier muss das gericht entscheiden ob es dazu eine entscheidung treffen oder aber ob es sich dieses themas erst der chsten legislaturperiode anl sslich der beschwerden gegen die negativen stimmengewichte der kommenden wahl annehmen nachdem es sich schon vor vier jahren nicht inhaltlich dazu erte der beschwerdef hrerin liegt bisher nur ein schreiben des berichterstatters vom dezember des letzten jahres vor dem sich dieser sehr knapp und manipulationserfolge bestreitend ert ein satz der den chsten beschwerdef hrern sehr hilfreich sein nnte zur vermeidung negativer stimmgewichte liegen dem gesetzgeber und dem bundesverfassungsgericht eine reihe von vorschl gen vor darunter unsere minimall sung zur verbesserungen des bundeswahlgesetzes
